HIHI!! My name is Icarus Wedekind, but I go by @slqughterhquse(e) on pretty much every platform you can find me on.
- I'm an amateur front-end dev, and I have taken a pretty good class on it, but I mostly develop for me and my friends.
- I'm a super big fan of final fantasy (especially the nova cryssalis sub-branch) and other jrpgs like nier and gravity rush!
- I spend a lot of my free time making stories and drawing fun stuff about them, but I also rock climb and cry sometimes
